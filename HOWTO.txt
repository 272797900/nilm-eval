How to use NILM-Eval
--------------------


(*) Set up the data

NILM-Eval is ready to use with the ECO data set. All that needs to be done is download the ECO data set from http://www.vs.inf.ethz.ch/res/show.html?what=eco-data and copy it to the folder "data".
Other data sets can be used as well - this requires the following format/procedure:

(*) Create configuration

(*) Create experiment

(*) Optional: create runfiles

(*) Run experiments


(todo: explain (1) "config" folder and (2) top level files and (3) aspect that stuff is "appliance-agnostic" (4) make experiment generation ... more configurable)
