1) Set up the data
==================

NILM-Eval is ready to use with the ECO data set. All that needs to be done is download the Matlab files of the ECO data set from http://www.vs.inf.ethz.ch/res/show.html?what=eco-data and copy it to the folder "data/eco".
The directory structure then looks as follows:

Household A, smart meter data:
Matlab/data/eco/smartmeter/0A/

Household A, plug data for plug Y:
Matlab/data/eco/plugs/0A/0Y/

These directories contain daily consumption patterns, one day per file. The file structure is explained in the documentation (file "consumption_data.txt"). When using other data sets, the first step consists in creating the corresponding Matlab files.













Other data sets can be used as well - this requires the following format/procedure:

(*) Create configuration

(*) Create experiment

(*) Optional: create runfiles

(*) Run experiments


(todo: explain (1) "config" folder and (2) top level files and (3) aspect that stuff is "appliance-agnostic" (4) make experiment generation ... more configurable)
