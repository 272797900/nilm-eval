The following process describes the steps necessary to perform an experiment with the ECO data set or with any other data set.

1) Set up the data
==================

NILM-Eval is ready to use with the ECO data set. All that needs to be done is download the Matlab files of the ECO data set from http://www.vs.inf.ethz.ch/res/show.html?what=eco-data and copy it to the folder "data/eco". The directory and file structure is explained in the documentation file "Documentation/consumption_data.txt". When using other data sets, the first step consists in creating the corresponding Matlab files.

2) Create a configuration
=========================

The folder "Matlab/input/configurations" contains default configurations for each of the algorithms. 






... tbd.

(*) Create experiment

(*) Optional: create runfiles

(*) Run experiments

(todo: explain (1) "config" folder and (2) top level files and (3) aspect that stuff is "appliance-agnostic" (4) make experiment generation ... more configurable)
