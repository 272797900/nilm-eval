The following process describes the steps necessary to perform an experiment with the ECO data set or with any other data set.

1) Set up the data
==================

NILM-Eval is ready to use with the ECO data set. All that needs to be done is download the Matlab files of the ECO data set from http://www.vs.inf.ethz.ch/res/show.html?what=eco-data and copy it to the folder "data/eco". The directory and file structure is explained in the documentation file "Documentation/consumption_data.txt". When using other data sets, the first step consists in creating the corresponding Matlab files.

2) Select a configuration
=========================

The folder "Matlab/input/configurations" contains configurations for each of the algorithms. Find a suitable configuration and remember its name. It is also possible to create a new configuration by copying a template file from "Matlab/input/configurations/templates" and modify it to your needs.

3) Create experiments
=====================









(*) Create experiment

(*) Optional: create runfiles

(*) Run experiments

(TODO: explain (1) configurations/experiments, (2) top level files and (3) "appliance-agnostic" characteristics of the framework)
